<p align="center"><font size="3"font face="arial"font color=#CC6666>Two months after SPM, I decided to work as a part-time promoter at Cheetah Corporation in Pacific Hypermarket & Department Store, Alor Setar, Kedah. I have worked there for almost 2 months and gained my first salary. This was an incredible journey since I was able to save some money at the same time building my communication skills and confidence with my customers and colleagues. I have many experiences working there. I also learnt on how to solve problem since I need to deal with various types of customers. To be honest, I really miss to work there and perhaps will apply for a position during my incoming semester break. </font></p>

I am one of the best student in school and often receives awards anually on my performance in study until SPM, with the achievement of 6As and 2Bs. Moreover, I really had a great experience to be in this school as I'm very active student during my high school year. I always participated in activities and also have been appointed as the Chairman of Red Cresent Moon Society. Although there were many bad experiences and struggles during those 5 years being a student, I am very determine and hardworking to prove myself that I can do better in everything. This school has given a lot of to me and I am thankful for everything I managed to achieve.

<br>
Not to forget, I still remember when my friends and I were chosen to be exchange students due to our excellent examination results for 1 week at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Sultan Abdul Halim which is a boarding school. I have never been in boarding school or living in dormitory for 17 years of my life! I learned how to manage my schedule with study and curricular activities for the whole week, facing difficulties in getting new friends as our group were divided to different classes. I love the surrounding of the school and how they learn. Absolutely different from us to be honest. And yeah! I got the chance to learn third language which is French but only in 3 hours period hahaha&#128541;</font></p></td>

After some period, I decided to further my study in Diploma in Information Management at UiTM Kedah. At first, I had difficulty in the dormitory when one of my roommate and her mother fought with my dad on the registration day. It was a horrible situation as I am the one that arrived first and choosing my bed but the girl and her mom demanded for my place instead haha. Since then, it does not going well since she did not talk to me and formed an ally to be with her. I am all alone but thankfully I am living beside my best friend's room hehe. Apart from that, I love to study here and it was easy to make friends. I did not do well in my first semester due to health problem but I bounced back to score in exam and received 2 times Dean's List!
My best friends here are Ahza Azlin, Nadhira Husna, Wani, Fatini, Aina Nazihah, and Shafa Atirah. Someday we will meet again on semester break this incoming August and go for a short trip together, hopefully&#x1F60D;
