<font color="#dd7100"<h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT<b></h4>
<p align="center"><font size="3"font face="arial"font color="#CC6666"></font>I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the success and outcome of this personal website that required a lot of guidance and assistance from many people especially from Encik Yamin bin Kamis as the lecturer of IMS456. His dynamism, vision, sincerity, and motivation during class and lecture have deeply inspired me and giving me the courage to perform better in order to finish this task. It was a great privilege and honour to study under his guidance. Moreover,I am extremely grateful for what he has offered me and my classmates. In addition, I am truly overwhelmed by the help of fellow friends and my parents that continuously supporting and keep motivating me to complete this website despite of facing a lot of challenges and struggles. This individual assessment would be a great experience for me as this is my first time to be involved and learn this course as well as discovering more fields and knowledge. 
With the strength that I obtained from my respected lecturer and friends, I hope that this semester will be a great experience and journey towards success and may our teaching and learning turn excellent together.<h5></p>
